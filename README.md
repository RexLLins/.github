## About RexLLins

**RexLLins** is a growing Nigerian-based initiative focused on building thoughtful, user-centered educational applications for learners, schools, and institutions across Africa and beyond.

We believe learning tools should be fast, accessible, and tailored to local challenges—whether it's textbooks, exams, or collaborative knowledge-sharing. Our team is committed to designing systems that help people learn better, faster, and with purpose.

This project, **EnRead**, is part of our larger mission to make digital education smarter, lighter, and more accessible—starting from the classroom and expanding into the world.

If you’re interested in partnerships or collaborations, feel free to reach out.
